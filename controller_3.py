    In scenario 3, there are many routers and switches. You need to classify a device as a router or a switch based on its DPID
    Remember one thing very carefully. The DPID gets assigned based on how you define tour devices in the topology file.
    So, be careful and DPID here should be coordinated with your definition in topology file.
    For the details of port info table, routing table, of different routers look into the project description document provided.
    Initialize any other data structures you wish to for the routers and switches here

    A word of caution:
    Your router and switch code should be the same for all scenarios. So, be careful to design your data structures for router
    and switches in such a way that your single piece of switch code and router code along with your data structure design
    should work for all the scenarios

    You need to classify a device as either switch or router based on its DPID received in the connection object during
    initialization in __init__ function in tutorial class. Based on the device type you need to call the respective function
    Here is the pseudo code to write

    if packet received from device type is switch:
      invoke switch_handler and pass the object (i.e., self) and the packet and packet_in
    else: (if it is not switch, it means router. We have only two kinds of devices, one is switch and one is router)
      invoke router_handler and pass the object (i.e., self) and the packet and packet_in
