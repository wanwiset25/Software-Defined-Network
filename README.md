# Software-Defined-Network
This is the major project for the class EE555: Broadband Network Architectures. It demonstrates an implementation of a Software Defined Network (SDN). It uses Mininet Linux virtual machine to virtualize the network and uses OpenFlow protocol to implement SDN. The programming language used is Python

The assignment is to implment traditional switching and routing functionalities to the SDN controller and whiteboxes. Then, the network connectivity is tested using ping and iperf on various topologies.
