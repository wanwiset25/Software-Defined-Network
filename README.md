# Software-Defined-Network
This is the major project for the class EE555: Broadband Network Architectures. It demonstrates an implementation of a Software Defined Network (SDN). It uses Mininet Linux virtual machine to virtualize the network and uses OpenFlow protocol to implement SDN. The programming language used is Python

The assignment is to implment traditional switching and routing functionalities to the SDN controller and whiteboxes. Then, the network connectivity is tested using ping and iperf on various topologies. 

Scenario 1 uses controller_1.py and topology_1.py. It is an implementation of layer 2 switching functionality in SDN similar to traditional switches.
Scenario 2 uses controller_2.py and topology_2.py. It is an implementation of layer 3 routing functionality in SDN similar to traditional routers.
Scenario 3 uses controller_3.py and topology_3.py. It is a combination of implementing switching and routing in SDN and uses a complex topology.
